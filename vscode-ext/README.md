# Solar Space

Effortlessly share your code and development environment with friends using Solar Space.

## Features

- **One-Click Sharing**: Adds a "Share Space" button to the status bar for quick access.
- **Smart Notifications**: Alerts you if the workspace is not a Git repository, not linked to GitHub, or has uncommitted/unpushed changes.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Copies a ready-to-share codespace link directly to your clipboard.

## How It Works

1. Click the "Share Space" button in the status bar.
2. If everything is set up correctly, a codespace link is copied to your clipboard.
3. Share the link with your friends to collaborate seamlessly.
